Please refer to the following as I NEVER owed MAF {$8100.00} as it reported. That was the original amount financed in XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX, and I made payments of {$250.00} a month through XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. \\n1 ) Car was purchased in XXXX XXXX and was financed IN HOUSE until XXXX XXXX per MAF \\'s statement of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with my first payment being due to MAF XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I was not responsible for any prior late payments ( MAF recorded my first delinquency as XXXX XXXX ) and that should never have been on my credit report. I do not know why or HOW it can be considered owned by MAF since XXXX XXXX. \\n2 ) There was NEVER a charge-off of {$5100.00} for the following reasons : a. Car was totaled XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I paid the {$250.00} XXXX payment plus additional interest fees on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The insurance company paid {$4200.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, leaving a balance per MAF of {$950.00} ( disputed since XXXX XXXX ) ; b. I was given a payoff in XXXX XXXX of {$5200.00}, with no expiration date, so I disputed the {$950.00} for 18 months before giving up. Finally, MAF sent me the accounting in XXXX XXXX, which supports my claim of payments made and wrongfully charged-off amounts. \\n3 ) On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, this account was PAID IN FULL per MAF \\'s own letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, yet MAF did not comply with the verbal agreement with its representative XXXX XXXX to remove negative credit AND it applied the {$500.00} as a payment toward the ( disputed ) balance owed rather than showing Paid in Full. \\nThe included supporting documents are as follows in a single PDF and numbered accordingly : 1 ) MAF - Accounting XXXX XXXX - received from MAF in XXXX XXXX - all writing on the page is by someone at MAF. This is a scan of exactly what I received. I was unaware that XXXX allegedly had my account prior to XXXX XXXX as all payments were made directly to the car dealership prior to XXXX XXXX.

       "'NONE OF YOUR \" MY LOAN IS A \\'\\' below apply to this situation! This was a car loan but the company is providing fraudulent information this is damaging my credit! \\n\\nRE : MidAtlantic Finance Company Account No. XXXX - NOT TO BE CONFUSED with my current MAF loan MidAtlantic Finance Company has reported several false items to all XXXX credit reporting agencies, and continues to do so. It is damaging my credit so much so that I was told I did n\\'t qualify for a mortgage. \\n\\nMost recently, I settled this account per agreement on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, yet MAF reported it is a payment on the amount claimed owed ( which has been disputed since XXXX XXXX ). But that is just the most recent false information that was reported. It is showing a debt of {$250.00} per month along with XXXX different amounts charged off of the {$950.00} ( plus interest ) and another {$5100.00} that INCLUDES the {$950.00}. Please refer to the following as I NEVER owed MAF {$8100.00} as it reported. That was the original amount financed in XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX, and I made payments of {$250.00} a month through XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. \\n1 ) Car was purchased in XXXX XXXX and was financed IN HOUSE until XXXX XXXX per MAF \\'s statement of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with my first payment being due to MAF XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I was not responsible for any prior late payments ( MAF recorded my first delinquency as XXXX XXXX ) and that should never have been on my credit report. I do not know why or HOW it can be considered owned by MAF since XXXX XXXX. \\n2 ) There was NEVER a charge-off of {$5100.00} for the following reasons : a. Car was totaled XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I paid the {$250.00} XXXX payment plus additional interest fees on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The insurance company paid {$4200.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, leaving a balance per MAF of {$950.00} ( disputed since XXXX XXXX ) ; b. I was given a payoff in XXXX XXXX of {$5200.00}, with no expiration date, so I disputed the {$950.00} for 18 months before giving up. Finally, MAF sent me the accounting in XXXX XXXX, which supports my claim of payments made and wrongfully charged-off amounts. \\n3 ) On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, this account was PAID IN FULL per MAF \\'s own letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, yet MAF did not comply with the verbal agreement with its representative XXXX XXXX to remove negative credit AND it applied the {$500.00} as a payment toward the ( disputed ) balance owed rather than showing Paid in Full. \\nThe included supporting documents are as follows in a single PDF and numbered accordingly : 1 ) MAF - Accounting XXXX XXXX - received from MAF in XXXX XXXX - all writing on the page is by someone at MAF. This is a scan of exactly what I received. I was unaware that XXXX allegedly had my account prior to XXXX XXXX as all payments were made directly to the car dealership prior to XXXX XXXX. MAF accounting shows only {$950.00} ( disputed ) owed as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. \\n2 ) MAF - Payoff XXXX XXXX XXXX - Receipts showing XXXX was sent to MAF on XXXX XXXX, XXXX prior to payoff deadline of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, for the agreed amount of {$500.00}. Also sticky note from conversation on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with XXXX XXXX prior to making XXXX payment later that day. \\n3 ) MAF - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Screenshot of email from XXXX XXXX TWELVE days after payoff with the agreement referenced below attached that she said she previously was remiss in sending. By then MAF had my payment of {$500.00} since XXXX XXXX and 9 days past the deadline. \\n4 ) MAF - Agreement XX/XX/XXXX - Agreement clearly stating that if the {$500.00} was paid by XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my account would be considered \" settlement of the account \\'\\' yet MAF has reported it as a PAYMENT.'"
